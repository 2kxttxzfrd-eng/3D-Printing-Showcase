    ### About Me
    Hello! My name is Tyler Liao. I am a student with a strong passion for engineering, particularly mechanical engineering, and a deep interest in solving real-world problems through design and innovation. I enjoy transforming ideas into practical solutions by combining creativity with precision, testing, and persistence.

    My interest in engineering has grown through hands-on projects, from designing and 3D-printing custom solutions for everyday challenges to repairing and assembling complex systems. One of my most meaningful projects was designing and building a fully functional 3D-printed camera from scratch using CAD, which taught me the importance of adaptability, iterative problem-solving, and attention to detail.

    I am especially motivated by collaborative learning and structured design processes, as I believe the best engineering solutions emerge from teamwork and diverse perspectives. I aspire to further develop my technical foundation through rigorous, college-level engineering experiences and hands-on projects that reflect real engineering practice.

    Ultimately, my goal is to pursue a career in mechanical engineering, where I can continue to innovate, challenge myself, and create solutions that make a meaningful impact.

        "story": """I designed and built a functional 3D-printed film camera as a hands-on engineering project. My original plan was to reuse parts from an existing camera, but when that wasn’t practical, I adapted by designing more components myself using CAD. Throughout the process, I faced challenges with 3D-printing limitations, including poor tolerances, weak parts, thread fitting issues, and light leaks that affected exposure. I addressed these problems through repeated redesigns, testing, and simple solutions like adjusting part thicknesses and sealing gaps with electrical tape. The project taught me the value of flexibility, simplifying designs, and learning through trial and error. It reflects my problem-solving mindset, persistence, and ability to work with limited resources to turn a complex idea into a working prototype."""

I carefully measured the dimensions of both the mug and the holder, then created a solution that allowed the mug to fit securely. Now, she can enjoy her favorite mug on her daily commute, making a small but meaningful improvement to her everyday routine."

        I designed a compact brush holder to solve a space limitation at a school Chinese calligraphy event organized by my mother. With limited table space, my goal was to create a sturdy, space-saving design that also attracted students’ attention.

        I measured the brushes to determine proper dimensions and structural requirements, ensuring stability and balance. I incorporated traditional Chinese festival patterns to enhance visual appeal. 
        
        During prototyping, I discovered issues with joint smoothness, which I corrected through sanding and reinforcing the connections. This process taught me the importance of precision and iteration in mechanical design.

        In future versions, I plan to redesign the joints with a twist-lock mechanism to improve strength and ease of assembly. This project strengthened my interest in 3D printing and mechanical engineering.

Not only does it make your bag look better but it also helps you keep track of time with the amazing feature of the watch beeping at the top of every hour. In addition, It also makes a great desk toy that helps you keep track of studying. When making this, I had to consider many things, including the materials I had available, sizing, and skill. I didn’t want something too complex that would take me days to design and something that would take hours to test print. I only had 8 large zip ties available and I used calipers to measure the dimensions. When designing these holes in pad I had to consider the tolerance of the Bambu Lab P1S and if I could get the sizing correct. To my surprise, I got it right on the first try by rounding up by .00 cm. I wanted the watch to be encased but not lost functionality so I made holes on the side so the buttons can still be accessible. There is a viewing hole on the back where the model details can be viewed. Overall, this design is sleek, minimalist, and small and the great part is it only took me a few hours to design and print."""
